# Data Directory

This directory stores sensor data in CSV format.

The file `sensor_data.csv` will be automatically created when the server receives its first data point.

## File Format

```csv
timestamp,device_id,temperature,humidity,co2
2024-11-03 10:30:00,livingroom_01,22.50,45.20,22.30,44.80,650
```

## Maintenance

- Backup this file regularly
- Archive old data periodically if file becomes large (>1GB)
- Monitor disk space

## Note

This `.gitkeep` file ensures the directory is tracked by git, but the actual CSV data files are ignored (see `.gitignore`).
