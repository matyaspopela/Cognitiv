1 -- Visibility
The device page contains this issue: when user first sees it, the thing that takes visual priority is the distribution visualisation, which doesnt tell anything about the current state.
    **FIX: 1.1 -Add numbers to the distribution (not just good,bad,worst but real ppm 
    limits).
            1.2 -Somehow make the current ppm more visible, give it a distinc shade/size.

2 -- Graph annotation
The circular pie graph doesnt show percentages, but data point amount 
    **FIX 2.1 -Show percentages instead of data points amount

3 -- Rudimentary firmware upload
The firmware upload is pointless, not very usefull
    **FIX 3.1 -Remove the firmware upload section completely, clean up all code tied to it.

4 -- incoherent naming
    **FIX 4.1 -Rename the 'settings' tab to management, so that it is clear what it does.

5 -- Overview page
The overview page is relatively empty, could server more purpose. Also, the average CO2 doesnt really make sense, it should be replaced with something more informative in the future.
    **FIX 5.1 -Below the 'Quick Actions' add an about section/blog post area or something.
